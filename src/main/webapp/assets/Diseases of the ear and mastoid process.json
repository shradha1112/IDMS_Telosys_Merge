It is the most common form of endolymphatic hydrops.\nFluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo resulting from nonsuppurative disease of the labyrinth; swelling of the endolymph-containing structures is the main pathologic finding.\nMeniere's disease can cause severe dizziness, a roaring sound in your ears called tinnitus, hearing loss that comes and goes and the feeling of ear pressure or pain. It usually affects just one ear. It is a common cause of hearing loss. Scientists don't yet know the cause. They think that it has to do with the fluid levels or the mixing of fluids in the canals of your inner ear. Symptoms occur suddenly and can happen as often as every day or as seldom as once a year. An attack can be a combination of severe dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss lasting several hours. There is no cure. However, you may be able to control symptoms by changing your diet or taking medicine so that your body retains less fluid. Severe cases may require surgery. nih: national institute on deafness and other communication disorders"},

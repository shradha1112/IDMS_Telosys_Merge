Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Besides the usual arthritis symptoms, it can cause chills and fever.one type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. It is inflammation of a joint in reaction to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. The infection that causes reactive arthritis is often in the bladder, urethra (urine tube), or for women, in the vagina. Sexually transmitted or food-borne bacteria can cause reactive arthritis.to diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery."},

It can affect any joint but is common in the wrist and fingers. More women than men get rheumatoid arthritis. It often starts between ages 25 and 55. You might have the disease for only a short time, or symptoms might come and go. The severe form can last a lifetime.rheumatoid arthritis is different from osteoarthritis, the common arthritis that often comes with older age. Ra can affect body parts besides joints, such as your eyes, mouth and lungs. Ra is an autoimmune disease, which means the arthritis results from your immune system attacking your body's own tissues. No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. Genes, environment and hormones might contribute. Treatments include medicine, lifestyle changes and surgery. These can slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases"},

The buildup of uric acid in the joints and tissues causes arthritis and inflammation.\nGout is a common, painful form of arthritis. It causes swollen, red, hot and stiff joints. Gout occurs when uric acid builds up in your blood. This happens if your body produces extra acid or does not eliminate enough, or if you eat too many foods with purines, such as liver and dried beans. Pseudogout has similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. However, it is caused by calcium phosphate, not uric acid.often, gout first attacks your big toe. It can also attack ankles, heels, knees, wrists, fingers and elbows. You are more likely to get gout if you\nare a man\nhave family member with gout\ndrink alcohol\nat first, gout attacks usually get better in days. Eventually, attacks last longer and occur more often. Uric acid buildup can lead to kidney stones. Untreated gout can cause permanent joint and kidney damage. You can treat gout with medicines. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nHereditary metabolic disorder characterized by recurrent acute arthritis, hyperuricemia and deposition of sodium urate in and around the joints, sometimes with formation of uric acid calculi."},

Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases. arthritis or simply years of use may cause a joint to wear away. This can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Treatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a sports injury, treatment often begins with the rice (rest, ice, compression and elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers, keeping the injured area from moving, rehabilitation, and sometimes surgery. For arthritis, injuries, or other diseases, you may need joint replacement surgery to remove the damaged joint and put in a new one. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nAny disorder of the joints.\nCondition in which there is a deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of the joints."},

Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases. arthritis or simply years of use may cause a joint to wear away. This can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Treatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a sports injury, treatment often begins with the rice (rest, ice, compression and elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers, keeping the injured area from moving, rehabilitation, and sometimes surgery. For arthritis, injuries, or other diseases, you may need joint replacement surgery to remove the damaged joint and put in a new one. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nA noninflammatory degenerative joint disease occurring chiefly in older persons, characterised by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hypertrophy of bone at the margins and changes in the synovial membrane. It is accompanied by pain and stiffness, particularly after prolonged activity. (on-line medical dictionary)\nA progressive, degenerative joint disease, the most common form of arthritis, especially in older persons. The disease is thought to result not from the aging process but from biochemical changes and biomechanical stresses affecting articular cartilage. In the foreign literature it is often called osteoarthrosis deformans.\nAn inflammatory process affecting a joint. Causes include infection, autoimmune processes, degenerative processes, and trauma. Signs and symptoms may include swelling around the affected joint and pain.\nAny disorder of the joints.\nCondition in which there is a deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of the joints.\nIf you feel pain and stiffness in your body or have trouble moving around, you might have arthritis. Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Some kinds of arthritis can also cause problems in your organs, such as your eyes or skin.one type of arthritis, osteoarthritis, is often related to aging or to an injury. Other types occur when your immune system, which normally protects your body from infection, attacks your body's own tissues. rheumatoid arthritis is the most common form of this kind of arthritis. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a form of the disease that happens in children. infectious arthritis is an infection that has spread from another part of the body to the joint. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nInflammation of the joints; tends to be chronic.\nNoninflammatory degenerative joint disease occurring chiefly in older persons, characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hypertrophy of bone at the margins, and changes in the synovial membrane, accompanied by pain and stiffness.\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can occur in any joint, but usually it affects your hands, knees, hips or spine.osteoarthritis breaks down the cartilage in your joints. Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage absorbs the shock of movement. When you lose cartilage, your bones rub together. Over time, this rubbing can permanently damage the joint. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include\nbeing overweight\ngetting older\ninjuring a joint\nno single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. Most doctors use several methods, including medical history, a physical exam, x-rays, or lab tests.treatments include exercise, medicines, and sometimes surgery. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nICD10Code-10-CM M19.90 is grouped within Diagnostic Related Group(s) (MS-DRG v35.0):\n553 Bone diseases and arthropathies with mcc\n554 Bone diseases and arthropathies without mcc"},

Joints can be damaged by many types of injuries or diseases. arthritis or simply years of use may cause a joint to wear away. This can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. Over time, a swollen joint can become severely damaged. Treatment of joint problems depends on the cause. If you have a sports injury, treatment often begins with the rice (rest, ice, compression and elevation) method to relieve pain, reduce swelling and speed healing. Other possible treatments include pain relievers, keeping the injured area from moving, rehabilitation, and sometimes surgery. For arthritis, injuries, or other diseases, you may need joint replacement surgery to remove the damaged joint and put in a new one. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nAny disorder of the joints.\nCondition in which there is a deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of the joints."},

Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips.sometimes the curve is temporary. It might be due to muscle spasms, inflammation or having different leg lengths. A birth defect, tumor or another disease might cause the spine to have a curve that isn't temporary. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse.

It predominantly affects young males. Patients present with stiffness and pain in the spine.\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine. It causes swelling between your vertebrae, which are the disks that make up your spine, and in the joints between your spine and pelvis. Ankylosing spondylitis is an immune disease. The disease is more common and more severe in men. It often runs in families. Early symptoms include back pain and stiffness. These problems often start in late adolescence or early adulthood. Over time, ankylosing spondylitis can fuse your vertebrae together, limiting movement. Symptoms can worsen or improve or stop altogether. The disease has no cure, but medicines can relieve the pain, swelling and other symptoms. Exercise can also help. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin disease\nChronic inflammation of the spine and the low back bone joint"},

The narrowing puts pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all.

It controls muscles in the back of your knee and lower leg and provides feeling to the back of your thigh, part of your lower leg and the sole of your foot. When you have sciatica, you have pain, weakness, numbness or tingling. It can start in the lower back and extend down your leg to your calf, foot, or even your toes. It's usually on only one side of your body.sciatica may be due to a ruptured intervertebral disk, narrowing of the spinal canal that puts pressure on the nerve called spinal stenosis, or an injury such as a pelvic fracture. In many cases no cause can be found.sometimes sciatica goes away on its own. Treatment, if needed, depends on the cause of the problem. It may include exercises, medicines and surgery.\nSyndrome characterized by pain radiating from the back into the buttock and into the lower extremity along its posterior or lateral aspect, and most commonly caused by protrusion of a low lumbar intervertebral disk; also used to refer to pain anywhere along the course of the sciatic nerve."},

Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. Acute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn't improve after three days, you should call your health care provider. You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary and alternative treatments, and sometimes surgery. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nPainful sensation in the back region.\nSensation of unpleasant feeling indicating potential or actual damage to some body structure felt in the back."},

Bursitis produces pain and tenderness and may limit the movement of nearby joints.you can get bursitis in your shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, heels and big toe. Injuries, overuse and repetitive stress are common causes of bursitis. Certain diseases, such as arthritis and gout, might also cause it. It sometimes occurs with tendinitis.you can usually treat bursitis with rest, ice, and medicines to ease pain and reduce swelling. Other treatments include ultrasound, physical therapy, steroid injections and, in rare cases, surgery. Stretching before you exercise, strengthening your muscles and resting when you do repetitive tasks might help prevent bursitis.\nAn inflammation in the area around the joint\nInflammation (swelling, pain, and warmth) of a bursa. A bursa is a flat, fluid-filled sac found between a bone and a tendon or muscle. It forms a cushion to help the tendon or muscle slide smoothly over the bone. Bursitis may be caused by long-term overuse, trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection. It usually affects the shoulder, knee, elbow, hip, or foot.\nInflammation or irritation of a bursa, the fibrous sac that acts as a cushion between moving structures of bones, muscles, tendons or skin.\nPainful inflammation of the bursa.

Other signs and symptoms include headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and painful menstruation.\nA common nonarticular rheumatic condition that is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, and stiffness.\nA common nonarticular rheumatic syndrome characterized by myalgia and multiple points of focal muscle tenderness to palpation (trigger points). Muscle pain is typically aggravated by inactivity or exposure to cold. This condition is often associated with general symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, stiffness, headaches, and occasionally depression. There is significant overlap between fibromyalgia and the chronic fatigue syndrome (fatigue syndrome, chronic). Fibromyalgia may arise as a primary or secondary disease process. It is most frequent in females aged 20 to 50 years.\nAn acute, subacute, or chronic painful state of muscles, subcutaneous tissues, ligaments, tendons, or fasciae caused by a number of agents such as trauma, strain, occupation, exposure, posture, infection, or arthritis.\nFibromyalgia makes you feel tired and causes muscle pain and \"tender points.\" tender points are places on the neck, shoulders, back, hips, arms or legs that hurt when touched. People with fibromyalgia may have other symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, morning stiffness, headaches, and problems with thinking and memory, sometimes called \"fibro fog.\"no one knows what causes fibromyalgia. Anyone can get it, but it is most common in middle-aged women. People with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases are particularly likely to develop fibromyalgia. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but medicines can help you manage your symptoms.

Osteoporosis is classified as primary (type 1, postmenopausal osteoporosis; type 2, age-associated osteoporosis; and idiopathic, which can affect juveniles, premenopausal women, and middle-aged men) and secondary osteoporosis (which results from an identifiable cause of bone mass loss).\nA condition that is marked by a decrease in bone mass and density, causing bones to become fragile.\nA disorder characterized by reduced bone mass, with a decrease in cortical thickness and in the number and size of the trabeculae of cancellous bone (but normal chemical composition), resulting in increased fracture incidence.\nLoss of bone mass and strength due to nutritional, metabolic, or other factors, usually resulting in deformity or fracture; a major public health problem of the elderly, especially women.\nMetabolic disorder associated with fractures of the femoral neck, vertebrae, and distal forearm. It occurs commonly in women within 15-20 years after menopause, and is caused by factors associated with menopause including estrogen deficiency.\nOsteoporosis makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but it is common in older women. As many as half of all women and a quarter of men older than 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis.risk factors include\ngetting older\nbeing small and thin\nhaving a family history of osteoporosis\ntaking certain medicines\nbeing a white or asian woman\nhaving osteopenia, which is low bone density\nosteoporosis is a silent disease. You might not know you have it until you break a bone. A bone mineral density test is the best way to check your bone health. To keep bones strong, eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin d, exercise and do not smoke. If needed, medicines can also help. nih: national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases\nReduction of bone mass without alteration in the composition of bone, leading to fractures.

infectious process affecting the bones.\nAn acute or chronic inflammation of the bone and its structures due to infection with pyogenic bacteria.\nInflammation of the bone caused by an infection, which may spread to the bone marrow and tissues near the bone. Osteomyelitis can cause severe pain in the infected bone. If it is not treated, it can kill bone tissue.\nInflammation of the bone marrow and adjacent bone caused by a pyogenic organism; it may remain localized or may spread through the bone to involve the marrow, cortex, cancellous tissue, and periosteum.\nLike other parts of the body, bones can get infected. The infections are usually bacterial, but can also be fungal. They may spread to the bone from nearby skin or muscles, or from another part of the body through the bloodstream. People who are at risk for bone infections include those with diabetes, poor circulation, or recent injury to the bone. You may also be at risk if you are having hemodialysis. Symptoms of bone infections include\npain in the infected area\nchills and fever\nswelling, warmth, and redness\na blood test or imaging test such as an x-ray can tell if you have a bone infection. Treatment includes antibiotics and often surgery."},

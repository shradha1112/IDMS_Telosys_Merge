The thyroid helps set your metabolism - how your body gets energy from the foods you eat.millions of people in the United States Have thyroid diseases. Most of them are women. If you have a thyroid disease, your body uses energy more slowly or quickly than it should. A thyroid gland that is not active enough, called hypothyroidism, is far more common. It can make you gain weight, feel fatigued and have difficulty dealing with cold temperatures. If your thyroid is too active, it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. That condition is hyperthyroidism. Too much thyroid hormone can make you lose weight, speed up your heart rate and make you very sensitive to heat. There are many causes for both conditions. Treatment involves trying to reset your body's metabolism to a normal rate."},

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by the chronic stimulation of the parathyroid glands in patients with chronic renal failure, rickets, and malabsorption syndromes.\nWhat: hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism: a condition due to an increase in the secretion of the parathyroids, causing generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica, elevated serum calcium, decreased serum phosphorus, and increased excretion of both calcium and phosphorus. Why: several rheumatological disorders are associated with hyperpara- thyroidism. First, hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis (which may mimic hyperparathyroidism with renal stone formation and colic) have an increased incidence in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Second, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism show an increased incidence of chondrocalcinosis with episodes of calcium pyrophosphate crystal induced synovitis. Approximately 25% of patients with hyperparathyroidism will show radiographic evidence of calcification of articular cartilage and joint capsules. Finally, there can be a synovial and cartilaginous lesion (\"osteogenic synovitis\") in patients with hyperparathyroidism which may mimic other primary rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In osteogenic synovitis there is softening and collapse of subchondral bone. Eventually the cartilage overlying this area erodes and is replaced by an irregular fibrocartilage. Eventually the articular surface of the joint is destroyed and secondary degenerative arthritis may develop."},

If your parathyroid glands make too much or too little hormone, it disrupts this balance. If they secrete extra pth, you have hyperparathyroidism, and your blood calcium rises. In many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands.

Ochronosis: the pathologic accumulation of a blue-black pigment in the connective tissues of persons with alkaptonuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism. These persons lack the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, resulting in a buildup of homogentisic acid, a precursor of the pigment. Why: the great majority of patients with ochronosis eventually develop an arthropathy clinically resembling degenerative joint disease. How: ochronosis is diagnosed by the combination of pigmentation of the cartilage, the presence of homogentisic acid in the urine, and arthritis usually involving the knees, hips, lumbosacral spine, and shoulders. The slate blue-black pigmentation is most apparent in the sclera of the eyes, the external ears, and the tympanic membranes. The cerumen may also show a dark discoloration. The presence of homogentisic acid in the urine is determined by the dark color which occurs when the urine is alkalinized and by paper chromatography.

You need a small amount of copper from food to stay healthy. Too much copper is poisonous.normally, your liver releases extra copper into bile, a digestive fluid. With wilson disease, the copper builds up in your liver, and it releases the copper directly into your bloodstream. This can cause damage to your brain, kidneys, and eyes.wilson disease is present at birth, but symptoms usually start between ages 5 and 35. It first attacks the liver, the central nervous system or both. The most characteristic sign is a rusty brown ring around the cornea of the eye. A physical exam and laboratory tests can diagnose it.treatment is with drugs to remove the extra copper from your body. You need to take medicine and follow a low-copper diet for the rest of your life. Don't eat shellfish or liver, as these foods may contain high levels of copper. At the beginning of treatment, you'll also need to avoid chocolate, mushrooms, and nuts.

These structural and functional abnormalities usually lead to hematuria; proteinuria; hypertension; and renal insufficiency.\nPathological processes of the kidney or its component tissues.\nYour kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood. They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom. Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems include:\ncancer\ncysts\nstones\ninfections\nyour doctor can run tests to find out if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail completely, a kidney transplant or dialysis can replace the work your kidneys normally do."},

It is characterized by the severe irreversible kidney damage (as measured by the level of proteinuria) and the reduction in glomerular filtration rate to less than 15 ml per min (kidney foundation: kidney disease outcome quality initiative, 2002). These patients generally require hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.\nYou have two kidneys, each about the size of your fist. Their main job is to filter wastes and excess water out of your blood to make urine. They also keep the body's chemical balance, help control blood pressure, and make hormones.chronic kidney disease (ckd) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of ckd.treatment may include medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood glucose, and lower blood cholesterol. Ckd can get worse over time. Ckd may lead to kidney failure. The only treatment options for kidney failure are dialysis or a kidney transplantation.you can take steps to keep your kidneys healthier longer:\nchoose foods with less salt (sodium)\nkeep your blood pressure below 130/80\nkeep your blood glucose in the target range, if you have diabetes\nYour kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists. They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood. They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom. Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years. Other kidney problems include:\ncancer\ncysts\nstones\ninfections\nyour doctor can run tests to find out if you have kidney disease. If your kidneys fail completely, a kidney transplant or dialysis can replace the work your kidneys normally do."},

It is usually the result of renal insufficiency. Most uremic toxins are end products of protein or nitrogen catabolism, such as urea or creatinine. Severe uremia can lead to multiple organ dysfunctions with a constellation of symptoms.\nA condition in which the kidneys stop working and are not able to remove waste and extra water from the blood or keep body chemicals in balance. Acute or severe renal failure happens suddenly (for example, after an injury) and may be treated and cured. Chronic renal failure develops over many years, may be caused by conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, and cannot be cured. Chronic renal failure may lead to total and long-lasting renal failure, called end-stage renal disease (esrd). A person in esrd needs dialysis (the process of cleaning the blood by passing it through a membrane or filter) or a kidney transplant.\nA severe irreversible decline in the ability of kidneys to remove wastes, concentrate urine, and maintain electrolyte balance; blood pressure; and calcium metabolism.\nAcute or chronic condition, characterized by the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter the blood substances, resulting in uremia and electrolyte imbalances. Acute renal failure is usually associated with oliguria or anuria, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary edema. Chronic renal failure is irreversible and requires hemodialysis.\nExcess in the blood of urea, creatinine and other nitrogenous end products of protein and aminoacid metabolism; also, the constellation of signs and symptoms of chronic renal failure.\nHealthy kidneys clean your blood by removing excess fluid, minerals and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and your blood healthy. But if the kidneys are damaged, they don't work properly. Harmful wastes can build up in your body. Your blood pressure may rise. Your body may retain excess fluid and not make enough red blood cells. This is called kidney failure.if your kidneys fail, you need treatment to replace the work they normally do. The treatment options are dialysis or a kidney transplant. Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks. No matter which treatment you choose, you'll need to make some changes in your life, including how you eat and plan your activities.

They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom. Most kidney diseases attack the nephrons. This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes. Causes can include genetic problems, injuries, or medicines. You are at greater risk for kidney disease if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, or a close family member with kidney disease. chronic kidney disease damages the nephrons slowly over several years.

These differ in terms of how abnormal the cells are and how likely it is that the condition will become cancer.\nBenign proliferation of the endometrium in the uterus. Endometrial hyperplasia is classified by its cytology and glandular tissue.

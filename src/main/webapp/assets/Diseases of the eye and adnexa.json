It affects your vision. Cataracts are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of all people in the United States either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. Common symptoms are\nblurry vision\ncolors that seem faded\nglare\nnot being able to see well at night\ndouble vision\nfrequent prescription changes in your eye wear\ncataracts usually develop slowly. New glasses, brighter lighting, anti-glare sunglasses or magnifying lenses can help at first. Surgery is also an option. It involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. Wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts. nih: national eye institute\nA condition in which the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. Symptoms include blurred, cloudy, or double vision; sensitivity to light; and difficulty seeing at night. Without treatment, cataracts can cause blindness. There are many different types and causes of cataracts. They may occur in people of all ages, but are most common in the elderly.\nA disorder characterized by partial or complete opacity of the crystalline lens of one or both eyes. This results in a decrease in visual acuity and eventual blindness if untreated.\nOpacity or cloudiness of the crystalline lens, which may prevent a clear image from forming on the retina; may be congenital or caused by trauma, disease, or age.\nPartial or complete opacity of the crystalline lens of one or both eyes that decreases visual acuity and eventually results in blindness. Some cataracts appear in infancy or in childhood, but most develop in older individuals. \nPartial or complete opacity on or in the lens or capsule of one or both eyes, impairing vision or causing blindness. The many kinds of cataract are classified by their morphology (size, shape, location) or etiology (cause and time of occurrence)."},

The consequences of the increased pressure may be manifested in a variety of symptoms, depending upon type and severity, such as excavation of the optic disk, hardness of the eyeball, corneal anesthesia, reduced visual acuity, seeing of colored halos around lights, disturbed dark adaptation, visual field defects, and headaches. \nGlaucoma damages the eye's optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first, but a comprehensive eye exam can detect it. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years.

But some lead to a permanent loss of vision. Common eye problems include\ncataracts - clouded lenses\nglaucoma - damage to the optic nerve from too much pressure in the eye\nretinal disorders - problems with the nerve layer at the back of the eye\nconjunctivitis - an infection also known as pinkeye\nyour best defense is to have regular checkups, because eye diseases do not always have symptoms. Early detection and treatment could prevent vision loss. See an eye care professional right away if you have a sudden change in vision or everything looks dim or if you see flashes of light. Other symptoms that need quick attention are pain, double vision, fluid coming from the eye and inflammation"},

Clinical features include retro-orbital pain that is aggravated by eye movement, loss of color vision, and contrast sensitivity that may progress to severe visual loss, an afferent pupillary defect (marcus-gunn pupil), and in some instances optic disc hyperemia and swelling. Inflammation may occur in the portion of the nerve within the globe (neuropapillitis or anterior optic neuritis) or the portion behind the globe (retrobulbar neuritis or posterior optic neuritis).\nInflammation of the second cranial nerve or optic nerve; commonly associated conditions include autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis, infections, and granulomatous diseases.\nWhat: optic neuritis. Optic neuritis: the inflammation, degeneration, or demyelination of the optic nerve. Why: optic neuritis may be present in patients with sarcoidosis or reiter's syndrome (rarely). How: clinically, patients with optic neuritis present with sudden loss of central vision and pain on moving the eye.

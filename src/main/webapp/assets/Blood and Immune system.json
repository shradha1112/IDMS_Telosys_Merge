Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation (change) in one of the genes for hemoglobin (the substance inside red blood cells that binds to oxygen and carries it from the lungs to the tissues). It is most common in people of west and central african descent.Disease characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, episodic painful crises, and pathologic involvement of many organs; the clinical expression of homozygosity for hemoglobin s.Sickle cell anemia is a disease in which your body produces abnormally shaped red blood cells. The cells are shaped like a crescent or sickle. They don't last as long as normal, round red blood cells, which leads to anemia. The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow. This can cause pain and organ damage. A genetic problem causes sickle cell anemia. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent. If you only have one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. About 1 in 12 african americans has sickle cell trait. A blood test can show if you have the trait or anemia. Most states test newborn babies as part of their newborn screening programs."

It may be inherited, usually in an autosomal dominant pattern, or acquired. It may lead to venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.A rare thrombophilia disorder characterized by deficiency of protein c. It results in venous thromboembolism.A rare thrombophilia disorder characterized by deficiency of protein s. It results in venous thromboembolism.An absence or deficiency in protein c which leads to impaired regulation of blood coagulation. It is associated with an increased risk of severe or premature thrombosis. (stedman's med. Dict., 26th ed.)An absence or reduced level of antithrombin iii leading to an increased risk for thrombosis.An autosomal dominant disorder showing decreased levels of plasma protein s antigen or activity, associated with venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Protein s is a vitamin k-dependent plasma protein that inhibits blood clotting by serving as a cofactor for activated protein c (also a vitamin k-dependent protein), and the clinical manifestations of its deficiency are virtually identical to those of protein c deficiency. Treatment with heparin for acute thrombotic processes is usually followed by maintenance administration of coumarin drugs for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis."

It usually affects the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, and skin. Cardiac involvement is also possible.An idiopathic systemic inflammatory granulomatous disorder comprised of epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells with little necrosis. It usually invades the lungs with fibrosis and may also involve lymph nodes, skin, liver, spleen, eyes, phalangeal bones, and parotid glands.An inflammatory disease marked by the formation of granulomas (small nodules of immune cells) in the lungs, lymph nodes, and other organs. Sarcoidosis may be acute and go away by itself, or it may be chronic and progressive.Inflammatory disease characterized by small lumps or granulomas in lymph nodes and other organs.Sarcoidosis is a disease that leads to inflammation, usually in your lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. It starts as tiny, grain-like lumps, called granulomas. Sarcoidosis can affect any organ in your body. No one is sure what causes sarcoidosis. It affects men and women of all ages and races. It occurs mostly in people ages 20 to 50, african americans, especially women, and people of northern european origin. Many people have no symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may SearchInclusion cough shortness of breath weight loss night sweats fatigue tests to diagnose sarcoidosis SearchInclusion chest x-rays, lung function tests, and a biopsy. Not everyone who has the disease needs treatment. If you do, prednisone, a type of steroid, is the main treatment.What: sarcoidosis: sarcoidosis: a disorder of unknown etiology that affects many organ systems with noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas. It has a special predilection for the lung and lymph tissues. Why: sarcoidosis can result in an acute arthritis commonly affecting the ankles and knees and less commonly the proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, and elbows. The acute arthritis is symmetric and lasts for a few weeks. A less common chronic arthritis is destructive and may have dactylitis and telescoping digits. How: sarcoidosis is a diagnosis of exclusion based on the clinical presentation and histology of biopsy tissue."

This condition can lead to severe dehydration in a matter of hours unless quickly treated.\nCholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food contaminated by feces . Cholera is rare in the United States. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with inadequate water treatment and poor sanitation, and lack of sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Often the infection is mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be severe. Severe symptoms include profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In severe cases, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment includes replacing fluid and salts and sometimes antibiotics. Anyone who thinks they may have cholera should seek medical attention immediately. Dehydration can be rapid so fluid replacement is essential. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."},

Some bacteria help to digest food, destroy disease-causing cells, and give the body needed vitamins. Bacteria are also used in making healthy foods like yogurt and cheese.but infectious bacteria can make you ill. They reproduce quickly in your body. Many give off chemicals called toxins, which can damage tissue and make you sick. Examples of bacteria that cause infections include streptococcus, staphylococcus, and e.

Infected mosquitoes spread the virus that causes it. People who get wnv usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms. The symptoms include a fever, headache, body aches, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands. They can last a few days to several weeks, and usually go away on their own.if west nile virus enters the brain, however, it can be life-threatening. It may cause inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis, or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis. A physical exam, health history and laboratory tests can diagnose it.older people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk. There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human wnv disease. The best way to avoid wnv is to prevent mosquito bites:\nuse insect repellent\nget rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets or barrels\nstay indoors between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active\nuse screens on windows to keep mosquitoes out"},

(from Dorland, 27th ed)\nShingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years. As you get older, the virus may reappear as shingles. Unlike chickenpox, you can't catch shingles from someone who has it.early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching, usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Blisters then form and last from one to 14 days. If shingles appears on your face, it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of shingles may last for weeks, months or even years after the blisters have healed. There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain. A vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects. The vaccine is for people 60 or over."},

The virus may cause retinitis, esophagitis, gastritis, and colitis. Morphologically, it is characterized by the presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies.\nCytomegalovirus (cmv) is a virus found around the world. It is related to the viruses that cause chickenpox and infectious mononucleosis (mono). Between 50 percent and 80 percent of adults in the United States have had a cmv infection by age 40. Once cmv is in a person's body, it stays there for life. Most people with cmv don't get sick. But infection with the virus can be very serious in babies and people with weak immune systems. If a woman gets cmv when she is pregnant, she can pass it on to her baby. Cmv does not harm most babies. But some develop lifelong disabilities.cmv is spread through close contact with body fluids. You should use good hygiene, including proper hand washing, to avoid catching or spreading the virus. Most people with cmv don't require treatment. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may prescribe antiviral medicine. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nInfection with cytomegalovirus, characterized by enlarged cells bearing intranuclear inclusions. Infection may be in almost any organ, but the salivary glands are the most common site in children, as are the lungs in adults."},

If you have symptoms, they may include a flu-like illness, with fever, cough, headache, rash and muscle aches. Most people get better within several weeks or months. A small number of people may develop a chronic lung or widespread infection.valley fever is diagnosed by testing your blood, other body fluids, or tissues.

It is common in latin america but not in the United States. Infected blood-sucking bugs, sometimes called kissing bugs, spread it. When an infected bug bites you, usually on your face, it leaves behind infected waste. You can get the infection if you rub it in your eyes or nose, the bite wound or a cut.

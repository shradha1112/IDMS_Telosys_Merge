The blockage leads to increased pressure, problems with blood flow, and inflammation. If the blockage is not treated, the appendix can burst and spread infection into the abdomen. This causes a condition called peritonitis.the main symptom is pain in the abdomen, often on the right side. It is usually sudden gets worse over time.

It can occur in people of all age groups but is most often diagnosed in young adults. Common symptoms are pain in the abdomen and diarrhea. Bleeding from the rectum, weight loss, joint pain, skin problems and fever may also occur. Children with the disease may have growth problems. Other problems can include intestinal blockage and malnutrition.treatment may include medicines, nutrition supplements, surgery or a combination of these options.

Symptoms include an enlarged liver, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dark urine.\nHepatitis. Inflammation of the liver; usually from a viral infection, but sometimes from toxic agents. Previously endemic throughout much of the developing world, viral hepatitis now ranks as a major public health problem in industrialized nations. The three most common types of viral hepatitis -- a, b, and c -- afflict over 500,000 people in the United States Each year, and millions worldwide. Hepatitis b alone ranks as the ninth leading killer in the world. Hepatitis a, an rna enterovirus, spread by contact with fecal matter or blood, most often through ingestion of contaminated food. Rarely fatal, it cannot be treated except by bed rest for 1 -- 4 weeks, during which time no alcohol should be consumed. It may recur after 3 months. Hepatitis b is shed through blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva approximately 4 -- 6 weeks after symptoms develop; the virus may take up to 6 months to incubate, and people may also become asymptomatic carriers. Hepatitis b may heal slowly, and is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Effective vaccines exist, but it is the fastest spreading form of the disease in the United States, with some 300,000 cases reported annually. Rates were up 80% from 1981 -- 1986 among iv drug users and up 38% during the same period among heterosexuals; among homosexuals, previously a high-risk group, rates held stable. Hepatitis c, infecting about 150,000 americans annually, remains in the blood for years and accounts for a large percentage of cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer cases. Its main mode of transmission is through blood transfusion, and possibly sexual intercourse. Types d and e are less frequently seen in the United States (sted98)\nInflammation of the liver and liver disease involving degenerative or necrotic alterations of hepatocytes.\nInflammation of the liver.\nInflammation of the liver; usually from a viral infection, but sometimes from toxic agents.\nYour liver helps your body digest food, store energy and remove poisons. Hepatitis is a swelling of the liver that makes it stop working well. It can lead to scarring, called cirrhosis, or to cancer.viruses cause most cases of hepatitis. The type of hepatitis is named for the virus that causes it; for example, hepatitis a, hepatitis b or hepatitis c. Drug or alcohol use can also lead to hepatitis. In other cases, your body mistakenly attacks its own tissues. You can help prevent some viral forms by getting a vaccine. Sometimes hepatitis goes away by itself. If it does not, it can be treated with drugs. Sometimes hepatitis lasts a lifetime.some people who have hepatitis have no symptoms.

Representative examples of non-neoplastic disorders include pancreatitis and pancreatic insufficiency. Representative examples of neoplastic disorders include cystadenomas, carcinomas, lymphomas, and neuroendocrine neoplasms.\nPathological processes of the pancreas.\nThe pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces juices that help break down food and hormones that help control blood sugar levels. Problems with the pancreas can lead to many health problems. These include\npancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas: this happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself\npancreatic cancer\ncystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder in which thick, sticky mucus can also block tubes in your pancreas\nthe pancreas also plays a role in diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body's immune system has attacked them. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas loses the ability to secrete enough insulin in response to meals."},

A person with celiac disease may become malnourished no matter how much food is consumed.\nA malabsorption syndrome that is precipitated by the ingestion of foods containing gluten, such as wheat, rye, and barley. It is characterized by inflammation of the small intestine, loss of microvilli structure, failed intestinal absorption, and malnutrition.\nDisease occurring in children and adults characterized by sensitivity to gluten, with chronic inflammation and atrophy of the mucosa of the upper small intestine; manifestations include diarrhea, malabsorption, steatorrhea, and nutritional and vitamin deficiencies.\nIf you have celiac disease and eat foods with gluten, your immune system responds by damaging the small intestine. Gluten is a protein in wheat, rye and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins and even the glue on stamps and envelopes. Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the digestive system, or in other parts of the body. One person might have diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children. Some people have no symptoms.celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests can help your doctor diagnose the disease. Your doctor may also need to examine a small piece of tissue from your small intestine.

They go from very happy, \"up,\" and active to very sad and hopeless, \"down,\" and inactive, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression. The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role. Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.if you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. A medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.if not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide.

The affected children are generally born clinically normal in most but not all cases. Their neurological and mental development begins to stagnate between the ages of 7 and 18 months with slowing down of the growth of head circumference and a rapid deterioration of brain functions marked by autistic behavior, dementia, apraxia of gait, loss of facial expression, deterioration of purposeful use of hands, ataxia, and severe dementia. There is an intermediate period of relative stable mental status, sometimes lasting several decades, which is followed by further neurological degradation, marked mainly by spasticity of the lower limbs and epilepsy.\nRett syndrome is a rare inherited disease that causes developmental and nervous system problems, mostly in girls. It's related to autism. Babies with rett syndrome seem to grow and develop normally at first. Between 3 months and 3 years of age, though, they stop developing and even lose some skills. Symptoms include\nloss of speech\nloss of hand movements such as grasping\ncompulsive movements such as hand wringing\nbalance problems\nbreathing problems\nbehavior problems\nlearning problems or mental retardation\nrett syndrome has no cure. You can treat some of the symptoms with medicines, surgery, and physical and speech therapy. Most people with rett syndrome live into middle age and beyond. They will usually need care throughout their lives. nih: national institute of child health and human development"},

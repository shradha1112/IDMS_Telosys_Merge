Characteristics include pustular lesions that rupture and discharge a thin, amber-colored fluid that dries and forms a crust. This condition is commonly located on the face, especially about the mouth and nose.\nA contagious bacterial cutaneous infection that affects children and is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus. It usually presents in the face with honey colored scabs.\nImpetigo is a skin infection caused by bacteria. Usually the cause is staphylococcal (staph) but sometimes streptococcus (strep) can cause it, too. It is most common in children between the ages of two and six. It usually starts when bacteria get into a break in the skin, such as a cut, scratch or insect bite. Symptoms start with red or pimple-like sores surrounded by red skin. These sores can be anywhere, but usually they occur on your face, arms and legs. The sores fill with pus, then break open after a few days and form a thick crust. They are often itchy, but scratching them can spread the sores. Impetigo can spread by contact with sores or nasal discharge from an infected person. You can treat impetigo with antibiotics."},

This can damage your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs. There are many kinds of lupus. The most common type, systemic lupus erythematosus, affects many parts of the body. Discoid lupus causes a rash that doesn't go away. Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun. Another type can be caused by medication. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is also more common in african american, hispanic, asian and native american women. The cause of lupus is not known. Lupus has many symptoms. Some common ones are\njoint pain or swelling\nmuscle pain\nfever with no known cause\nred rashes, often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\")\nthere is no one test to diagnose lupus, and it may take months or years to make the diagnosis.

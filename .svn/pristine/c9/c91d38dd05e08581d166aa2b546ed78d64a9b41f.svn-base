A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (mci), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age. Many, but not all, people with mci will develop ad. In ad, over time, symptoms get worse. People may not recognize family members or have trouble speaking, reading or writing. They may forget how to brush their teeth or comb their hair. Later on, they may become anxious or aggressive, or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.

Myelin is a substance that contains both protein and fat (lipid), serving as a nerve insulator and helping in the transmission of nerve signals.\nA progressive autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system resulting in demyelination. Patients develop physical and cognitive impairments that correspond with the affected nerve fibers.\nAn autoimmune disorder mainly affecting young adults and characterized by destruction of myelin in the central nervous system. Pathologic findings include multiple sharply demarcated areas of demyelination throughout the white matter of the central nervous system. Clinical manifestations include visual loss, extra-ocular movement disorders, paresthesias, loss of sensation, weakness, dysarthria, spasticity, ataxia, and bladder dysfunction. The usual pattern is one of recurrent attacks followed by partial recovery (see multiple sclerosis, relapsing-remitting), but acute fulminating and chronic progressive forms (see multiple sclerosis, chronic progressive) also occur.

It damages the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects your nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks messages between your brain and your body, leading to the symptoms of ms.

The two major subtypes are common migraine (without aura) and classic migraine (with aura or neurological symptoms). \nA common, severe type of vascular headache often associated with increased sympathetic activity, resulting in nausea, vomiting, and light sensitivity.\nIf you suffer from migraine headaches, you're not alone. About 12 percent of the United States Population gets them. Migraines are recurring attacks of moderate to severe pain. The pain is throbbing or pulsing, and is often on one side of the head. During migraines, people are very sensitive to light and sound. They may also become nauseated and vomit. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men. Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights or zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision. Many things can trigger a migraine. These include\nanxiety\nstress\nlack of food or sleep\nexposure to light\nhormonal changes (in women)\ndoctors used to believe migraines were linked to the opening and narrowing of blood vessels in the head. Now they believe the cause is related to genes that control the activity of some brain cells. Medicines can help prevent migraine attacks or help relieve symptoms of attacks when they happen. For many people, treatments to relieve stress can also help.\nNeural condition characterized by a severe recurrent vascular headache, usually on one side of the head, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and photophobia, sometimes preceded by sensory disturbances; triggers include allergic reactions, excess carbohydrates or iodine in the diet, alcohol, bright lights or loud noises."},

Symptoms include loud or abnormal snoring, daytime sleepiness, irritability, and depression.\nCessation of breathing for 10 seconds or more during sleep and consequent oxygen desaturation.\nCessation of breathing for short periods during sleep. It is classified as obstructive, central, or mixed obstructive-central. It can occur at any age but it is more frequent in people over forty. Risk factors include male sex and obesity.\nDisorders characterized by multiple cessations of respirations during sleep that induce partial arousals and interfere with the maintenance of sleep. Sleep apnea syndromes are divided into central (see sleep apnea, central), obstructive (see sleep apnea, obstructive), and mixed central-obstructive types.\nSleep apnea is a common disorder that can be serious. In sleep apnea, your breathing stops or gets very shallow. Each pause in breathing typically lasts 10 to 20 seconds or more. These pauses can occur 20 to 30 times or more an hour. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. That means you are unable to get enough air through your mouth and nose into your lungs. When that happens, the amount of oxygen in your blood may drop. Normal breaths resume with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents and other medical problems.

Suddenly, a sharp, piercing pain shoots through the wrist and up your arm. Just a passing cramp? more likely you have carpal tunnel syndrome. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway of ligament and bones at the base of your hand. It contains nerve and tendons. Sometimes, thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and causes the nerve to be compressed. Symptoms usually start gradually. As they worsen, grasping objects can become difficult. What causes the problem? some people have smaller carpal tunnels than other people do. Other causes include performing assembly line work, wrist injury, or swelling due to certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Treatment includes resting your hand, splints, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, and surgery."},

Mononeuritis multiplex: the simultaneous inflammation or degeneration of two or more peripheral nerves which are remote from one another. Why: mononeuritis multiplex can occur in polyarteritis if the nutrient arteries of peripheral nerve trunks are involved by the disease. How: the patient with mononeuritis multiplex may present with motor or sensory changes which occur in an irregular and asymmetrical distribution on his body. These changes may be areas of paresthesia or anesthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, weakness or paralysis of muscle group. For example, a typical patient might present with paresthesia of the radial aspect of his left hand representing involvement of the left median nerve and weakness of his right foot and ankle representing right tibial nerve involvement.

Hmsn i is associated with abnormal nerve conduction velocities and nerve hypertrophy, features not seen in hmsn ii.\nA progressive hereditary disorder that causes nerve damage\nAn inherited degenerative disorder involving the peripheral nerves. It is caused by mutations in the genes that are responsible for the production of proteins necessary for the function and structure of the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness in the feet, legs, hands, and arms and loss of sensation in the limbs.\nCharcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) is a group of genetic nerve disorders. It is named after the three doctors who first identified it. In the United States, cmt affects about 1 in 3,300 people. Cmt affects your peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry movement and sensation signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Symptoms usually start around the teen years. Foot problems such as high arches or hammertoes can be early symptoms. As cmt progresses, your lower legs may weaken. Later, your hands may also become weak. There is no cure. The disease can be so mild you don't realize you have it or severe enough to make you weak. Many people with cmt lead active lives and have a normal life span.
